Yesterday I had the great pleasure of speaking to graduate students at U Toronto as one of the panelists on a DH Roundtable organized by Matt Schneider and Elisa Tersigni. The graduate students asked excellent questions, and I really appreciated the opportunity to think through my own experiences with DH in the past six years. I also got to tour the print shop in the bottom of Massey College, and it was just delightful, and I want to go back, and I am more than a little envious of graduate students who have the opportunity to learn letterpress printing there.

This post is a link dump &#8212; I recommended various sites/essays/tools in the conversations after the roundtable, and I thought it would make it easier for people to find them if I collected them here. I jotted down a list of them on the subway back to Union Station, so I think I&#8217;ve remembered them all, but if I&#8217;ve forgotten something, then hopefully someone will nudge me on Twitter or via email.

[TransformDH](http://transformdh.org "TransformDH"), which examines issues of Race, Ethnicity, Gender, Sexuality and Class in DH

Brian Croxall&#8217;s [tutorial for a Simile Timeline exercise](http://briancroxall.net/TimelineTutorial/TimelineTutorial.html); the [Simile Timelines assignment](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BwmeOZdY9oiPNU4zRU5BYThIZ1k/view?usp=sharing) I developed for students in one of my courses several years ago; the [outcome of that assignment](http://www.paigemorgan.net/timelines/). And [Google Fusion Tables,](https://support.google.com/fusiontables/answer/2571232?hl=en) which allow for similar visualizations based on spreadsheets &#8212; there&#8217;s no timeline functionality, but you also don&#8217;t have to precode any HTML.

[Bamboo Dirt / the DiRT (Digital Research Tool) Directory](http://dirtdirectory.org), a good source for finding all sorts of tools for digital scholarship.

[USC/ANVC&#8217;s Scalar](http://scalar.usc.edu) CMS, which has really neat functionality in terms of allowing multilinear scholarship, even though I think that its export functionality needs work, and hope that ANVC will keep improving it.

The [revised Demystifying Digital Scholarship values](http://www.paigemorgan.net/draft-the-values-of-digital-scholarship-v-2-0/) (which contain a link to the earlier version)

[Model View Culture](https://modelviewculture.com), a journal about tech, culture, and diversity media.

I will note here, for personal record-keeping as much as anything, that when asked what I wish I had known when I started, I said that I had felt very tentative/uncertain about the value/importance of writing publicly about my work. I now know that said public writing was really important. It helped me find my voice, and develop my own sense of the field of DH, and what I wanted to do. I think, in fact, that blogging and tweeting have been instrumental in helping me make the transition from being a graduate student to a professional academic (in humanities generally, not just in re: DH). Writing in public allowed me to go from being an DH onlooker to being a participant in the larger community of practice.

More on that subject in a future post, I hope. But not this morning.
